                <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking
                    at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
                    as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop
                    publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                <h3>Synopsis</h3>
                <p>A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table – Samsa was a travelling salesman – and above it
                    there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded
                    frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that
                    covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.</p>
